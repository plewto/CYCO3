BUG 0001 2018.11.17 Status Indeterminate.
    QBAll may not be processing articulation +REST+ events properly.
    Brief observations show QBALL may be producing note-on events when
    the articulation is supposed to be a rest.  Worse the corresponding
    note-off event may not be generated causing a stuck note on what
    should be a rest.
