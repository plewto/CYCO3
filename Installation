CYCO3 Installation.

CYCO is implemented in 100% Common Lisp and has relatively few
requirements. 


1) Select a Lisp.
   CYCO has been extensively tested with SBCL and to a lesser extent with
   ABCl.  Of the two SBCL is faster and has far better compile time checks.
   Another advantage of SB is that it allows saving snapshots of CYCO's
   state as executable.

   Other ANSI Lisp should work but have not been tested.

2) Place the top-level CYCO3 directory in a convenient location.

3) Configuration

   The default configuration file is ~/.config/cyco3/cyco-config.lisp
   and other configuration files should be placed in this same directory.

   Configuration is not mandatory but is quite useful for defining MIDI
   instrument proxies to use within CYCO.   The folder CYCO3/config/
   contains two example configurations.  One is a simple scheme using
   general-midi instruments.  The other is a more complex and is used as my 
   personal configuration.  Both are annotated.

   Initially you can just create a hard link to the config directory

   $ cd .config
   $ ln -s <location-of-CYCO3>/config cyco3

4) Create a projects folder.

   Each CYCO project has an associated folder where all of it's files should
   be located.   By default these project folders are located at

   ~/cyco-projects/

   The CYCO3/examples folder contains several tutorials.  If you which to
   execute the tutorials you may want to copy them to ~/cyco-projects/

		            Running CYCO

Once cyco has been installed use the following instruments to start it.

1) Navigate to the CYCO3 folder.

   $ cd CYCO3

2) Start lisp, here using Steel Banks
   
   $ sbcl

3) At the Lisp REPL prompt enter

   * (load "src/cyco")


4) Once the Lisp prompt returns enter: 

  * (cyco)
  ___  _  _  ___  _____ 
 / __)( \/ )/ __)(  _  )
( (__  \  /( (__  )(_)( 
 \___) (__) \___)(_____)

The lisp prompt should change to

  CYCO:



When starting CYCO this way the configuration files are not automatically
loaded.  This allows different configurations to be created to meet
specific needs.  To load the default (general MIDI) configuration use:


  CYCO: (load-config)

  Check the file ~/.config/cyco-config.lisp to make sure it loads the
  desired configuration.


Once a configuration has been loaded you may wish to create an executable.
THIS ONLY WORKS WITH SBCL.

   CYCO: (save-snapshot "name-of-snapshot")

After creating the snapshot CYCO will terminate.


Starting CYCO from a snapshot is much quicker and there is no need to load
the cyco source files or configurations.  However you do still need to call
the (cyco) function to enter the CYCO name-space:


$ name-of-snapshot
* (cyco)

  ___  _  _  ___  _____ 
 / __)( \/ )/ __)(  _  )
( (__  \  /( (__  )(_)( 
 \___) (__) \___)(_____)
