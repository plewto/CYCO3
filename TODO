* Test/Examples

* More Patterns
    - switch/gate
    - non-binary shift-register
    
* More Part types:
    - arpeggiator(s)

* Web scrapers for: 
    internet online encyclopedia of integer Sequences
    Slonimsky 'thesaurus of scales and melodic patterns'

* Allow fractional part completion
    This looks harder then expected.
    Perhaps adding filters on MIDI event list is a better approach.
    

* Evaluate symbolic controller-names
    Are they being used.
    Can they be depreciated.
