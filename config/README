			 CYCO Configuration README

There are no predefined configuration requirements and the user is free to
structure configuration to meet their specific needs.

The intended use for configuration is to define the properties of the
available MIDI instruments.   Two example configuration schemes are
provided:

   1) general, a simple scheme based on general MIDI instruments.
   2) sj, a much more involved scheme for my personal use.



Two global variables establish the location and name of the configuration
files:

    *CYCO-CONFIG-DIRECTORY*

      Location of the configuration directory.
      defaults to   "~/.config/cyco3/


    *CYCO-CONFIG-FILE*

      Name of main configuration file relative to above directory.
      defaults to  "cyco-config.lisp"


The function LOAD-CONFIG loads the main configuration file.  It takes two
optional arguments which may be used to bypass either
*CYCO-CONFIG-DIRECTORY* or *CYCO-CONFIG-FILE*

The function LOAD-CONFIG-FILE loads a lisp file relative to the location
contained in *CYCO-CONFIG-DIRECTORY*



The configuration files are not automatically loaded when CYCO starts.  This
allows more flexibility for creating executable snapshots of the current
CYCO state.   See (LOAD-CONFIG) and (SAVE-SNAPSHOT)

save-snapshot is only available with SBCL.
