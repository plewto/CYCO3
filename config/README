			 CYCO Configuration README

Configuration uses the concept of a 'profile' and is optional.  Profiles
customize CYCO to match the available external MIDI instruments.  By
default configuration files are located in

      ~/.config/cyco/

Each profile is located in a sub-folder of the above location.   

    ~/.config/cyco/foo/ 

Each profile must have a file named 'config.lisp' which is responsible for
defining the profile and loading any additional files.  All profile
filenames must be lower-case and contain no white space. 

   ~/.config/cyco/foo/config.lisp


Other then the above requirements there are no pre-defined structures to a
profile's content.   The user is free to do with them what they will. 


Use (load-profile 'foo) to load the file ~/.config/cyco/foo/config.lisp
If a profile name is not specified it defaults to the previous profile.
The initial default profile is 'default.


The distribution contains two example profiles in in CYCO/config.

  1) general-midi - A very basic profile using general MIDI instruments.
  2) sj - A much more involved profile used for my personal work.  It is
     included for illustration but unlikely to be useful to anyone else. 
     I will try to keep it heavily annotated though.

The default profile is a sym-link to general-midi


Initially you may wish to create ~/.config/cyco as a sym-link to
CYCO/config.
