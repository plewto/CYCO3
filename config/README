			 CYCO Configuration Readme

The user is free to structure CYCO configuration files to meet their
specific needs.  There are no predefined configuration requirements.

The intended use for configuration is to define the properties of the
available MIDI instruments.   Two example configuration schemes are
provided:

   1) general, a basic scheme based on general MIDI instruments.
   2) sj, a much more involved scheme fro my personal use.



Two global variables establish the location and name of the configuration
files:

    *CYCO-CONFIG-DIRECTORY*

      Location of the configuration directory.
      default  "~/pigiorn/cyco-config/"


    *CYCO-CONFIG-FILE*

      Name of main configuration file relative to above directory.
      defaults  "cyco-config.lisp"


The function LOAD-CONFIG loads the main configuration file.  It takes two
optional arguments which may be used to bypass either
*CYCO-CONFIG-DIRECTORY* or *CYCO-CONFIG-FILE*

The function LOAD-CONFIG-FILE loads a lisp file relative to the location
contained in *CYCO-CONFIG-DIRECTORY*



The configuration files are not automaticaly loaded when CYCO starts.  This
allows more flexibility for creating executable snapshots of the current
CYCO state.   Use (LOAD-CONFIG)
