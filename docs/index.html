  <h1 class="banner">CYCO</h1>
  <p class="body">
    CYCO is a lisp based music composition language with a rich set pattern 
    generators and a project centric design.
  </p>
  <H2 class="heading">History</H2>
  <p class=body>
  CYCO began as a set of extensions to <a href=http://commonmusic.sourceforge.net/ class="link">Common Music 2</a> called CMU (Common Music Utility). 
  CMU primarily added a project level framework and a hierarchical time structure.
  Eventually Common Music moved to version 3 invalidating much of CMU.
  As CMU only used a small subset of Common Music's features, a decision was made to
  separate CMU from Common Music.  The name CYCO is a play 
  on the commonly used pattern generator, the 'cycle'.</p>
  <p class=body>
  CYCO is written in 100% Lisp and was developed and tested with <a href=http://www.sbcl.org/ class="link">SBCL</a> </p>
  <p class="footnote">
    As of 11 Septemper 2020, CYCO is known not to work under CLISP due to the 
    STRING-REPLACE function in util/string-utilities.lisp
  </p>
  <H2 class="heading">Features</H2>
  <ul>
    <li>Project centric design.</li>
    <li>Functional time signatures.</li>
    <li>A rich set of algorithmic pattern generators.</li>
    <li>Symbolic names for common music parameters.</li>
    <li>Chord tables.</li>
    <li>Hierarchical instrument definitions, IE a snare may be a sub-instrument of a drum-machine. </li>
    <li>Plugins</li>
    <li>Generates MIDI files for output.</li>
    <li>Under SBCL CYCO's state may be saved as an executable.</li>
  </ul>
  <H2 class="heading">Usage Overview</H2>
  <p class="body">
    Briefly compositions are defined by writing a series of Lisp files in a dedicated 
    <em>Project</em> directory.  Once defined the project is rendered to a selected output format.  
    Currently only MIDI file output is supported with an external player required for playback.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    At any one time there is a single <em>Current Project</em>.  Several short-cut
    functions are provided to quickly reload the current project, or even a section within the project,
    while it is under development.
  </p>
  <a id="instalation"></a>
  <H2 class="heading">Instalation</H2>
  <p class="body">
    Other then a functional Lisp the basic CYCO installation has no external
    dependencies.
  </p>
  <ol>
  <li>
  Place cyco3 distribution folder in a convenient location. <br>
  <pre>The default location is ~/dev/cyco3</pre></li>
  <li>
  Create the following directories:<br>
  <pre>
   ~/.config/cyco/
   ~/.config/cyco/plugins/
   ~/cyco-projects/
</pre>
  
  If you elect to use alternate locations modify the file
         cyco3/src/local-config.lisp accordingly.<br><br></li>
  <li>
  In a terminal navigate to the cyco3 directory and fire up your favorite Lisp.<br><br></li>
  <li>
  At the Lisp prompt enter<br>
  <br><strong>(LOAD "src/cyco")</strong>
  <br><br></li>
  <li>
  After the source files load enter the command <br>
  <br><strong>(CYCO)</strong>
<br><br><p class='footnote'>At this point you may run the test suite by entering 
  (LOAD&nbsp;"test/cyco-test")<br>
  
  If you run the test, restart CYCO before proceeding.</footnote><br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
  CYCO is now ready for use.  However you may wish to customize it to
     match your available MIDI equipment.  You do this by creating plugins
     in the ~/.config/cyco/plugins/ directory as detailed elsewhere.  <br><br></li>
  <li>
  If you are using SBCL you have the option of saving the current state of
     CYCO to an executable.  <br><br>
  <strong>(SAVE-SNAPSHOT <i>executable-name</i>)</strong><br><br>
  Snapshots are considerably faster then running from source.  After
     starting CYCO from a snapshot you must first enter <strong>(CYCO)</strong> at the initial
     Lisp prompt.</li>
