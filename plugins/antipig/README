cyco3 Antipig plugin README

Antipig is a drop in replacement for the (currently broken) pig plugin, see
BUG 0023.  It relies on an intermediate Python script to handle OSC
transmission. 

Requirements:

    I.  Pigiron (none of this makes sense without it)
        https://github.com/plewto/Pigiron

    II. Python 3 with the python-osc module
        pip install python-osc

Configuration:

    I.  Pigiron
    
        The file 'antipig' is a Pigiron script to setup the proper
        MIDI process tree.

       A) Copy antipig to a location visible to Pigiron.  The default
          location on Linux is  ~/.config/pigiron/batch/

       B) Two lines in this file establish the MIDI input and output
          devices. Replace 'MiniLab' and 'FastTrack' in the following two
          lines with the desired MIDI devices:
	  
              new MIDIInput, in, MiniLab
	      new MIDIOutput, out, FastTrack

	  To see a list of available MIDI devices, start Pigiron and enter
	  the following two commands:

              'q-midi-inputs'   and   'q-midi-outputs'

          These commands will display list of MIDI device names.  It is
          only necessary to specify a unique sub-string of the listed
          names.

       C) Start Pigiron and enter 'antipig'.  This will need to be done for
          each session.

    II.  CYCO
    
         The file antipig-main.lisp defines the CYCO interface to Pigiron.
         Two lines may need to be edited.

         A) Set *ANTIPIG-TEMP-DIRECTORY*
	    The default location /tmp/antipig is probably fine. However if
	    another location is used, it must also be changed in
	    osc-handler.py

         B) *ANTIPIG-OSC-HANDLER*
	    This symbol holds the location of the Python osc-handler
	    script.  The default value assumes the main cyco3 directory is
	    located in the home directory  ~/cyco3/.   If it is elsewhere,
	    set the value to the location of osc-handler.py.


    III. Python
    
         The file osc-handler.py is a Python script which handles the
         actual OSC transmissions to Pigiron.

         A) The python-osc package must be available, to install use
	    pip install python-osc

         B) This file must be executable.

         C) This files location must correspond with *ANTIPIG-OSC-HANDLER*
            as describes above.

         D) If the temporary directory is anything other then /tmp/antipig,
	    the line temp_dir = 'xxx' must be changed accordingly.
