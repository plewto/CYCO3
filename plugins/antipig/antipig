# CYCO3 Antipig plugin file, a Pigiron 'batch' file.
#
# Copy this file to a location where Pigiron can find it.  The default
# location on Linux is   ~/.config/batch/
# Start Pigiron and issue the command:  antipig
# 
# If all goes well the following structure should be created:
#
#   MIDIInput -> SingleChannelFilter -> Distributor -+-> MIDIOutput -> Monitor
#                                                    |
#                                        MIDIPlayer -+
#
# From an Operator name point of view, the same structure is:
#
#        in --> filter --> distributor --+--> out --> mon
#                                        |
#                               player --+
#
# The MIDIInput and MIDIOutput device names *MUST* be set to actual devices
# for your system, change 'MiniLab' and 'FastTrack' below to the desired
# devices.  To see list of available MIDI devices enter 'q-midi-inputs' and
# 'q-midi-outputs' at the Pigiron prompt.
