;;;; The Matrix 1000 is the module version of the Matrix-6 but with 1000
;;;; memory slots; 200 user RAM, 800 factory ROM.
;;;;
;;;; I believe these were the first instruments to re-introduce the concept
;;;; of a modulation-matrix into digitally controlled synthesizers.  In
;;;; short they brought at least some of the flexibility of modular
;;;; synthesizers back from the brink; something that was sorely missing at
;;;; the time.
